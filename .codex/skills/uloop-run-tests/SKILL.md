# uloop run-tests

Execute Unity Test Runner. When tests fail, NUnit XML results with error messages and stack traces are automatically saved. Read the XML file at `XmlPath` for detailed failure diagnosis.

`uloop run-tests` automatically compiles pending script changes before running tests. Pass `--skip-compile` only while validating active hot-reload patches, because the compile clears those patches; otherwise let the default compile surface errors and run against current scripts.

Before executing tests, `uloop run-tests` saves unsaved loaded Scene changes and unsaved current Prefab Stage changes by default. If saving fails, it returns `Success: false`, keeps `TestCount` at `0`, lists the unsaved items in `Message`, and does not start the Unity Test Runner.

Active pause points are automatically cleared (the underlying code patches are removed as well) before test execution begins. Cleared IDs are reported in the response's `ClearedPausePointIds` field.

A test run can end by discarding active hot-reload changes: script edits imported during the run are compiled when the test runner releases its assembly-reload lock, and that deferred domain reload wipes the patches even though the tests themselves ran patched. The response's Warning field reports this; re-apply 'uloop hot-reload' or bake the edits in with 'uloop compile' before the next Play or test run.

`NoTestsFound` means zero tests matched — not a test failure. Check `NoTestsFoundExplanation` and `Message` for asmdef hints.

## Usage

```bash
uloop run-tests [options]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--test-mode` | string | `EditMode` | Test mode: `EditMode`, `PlayMode` |
| `--filter-type` | string | `all` | Filter type: `all`, `exact`, `regex`, `assembly` |
| `--filter-value` | string | - | Filter value (test name, pattern, or assembly) |
| `--fail-on-unsaved-changes` | flag | - | Fail before test execution if unsaved editor changes remain instead of auto-saving them |
| `--skip-compile` | flag | - | Skip the automatic compile before running tests; use only while validating active hot-reload patches. |
| `--timeout-seconds` | integer | `600` | Maximum seconds to wait for RunFinished before canceling the await (max `1500`). Increase for long suites; on timeout the Test Runner may still be running until stop handling lands |

exact matches the full test name (Namespace.Class.Method); use regex to run a whole test class, e.g. --filter-type regex --filter 'MyGame\.Tests\.PlayerTests\.'

## Output

Returns JSON with:

- `Success` (boolean): Whether all tests passed
- `Status` (string): Machine-readable execution status such as `Passed`, `Failed`, `NoTestsFound`, or `ExecutionFailed`
- `HasFailures` (boolean): Whether any discovered test failed
- `Message` (string): Summary message
- `NoTestsFound` (boolean): Whether Unity Test Runner discovered zero matching tests
- `NoTestsFoundExplanation` (string): Agent-facing explanation when `NoTestsFound` is true; empty otherwise
- `CompletedAt` (string): ISO timestamp when the run finished
- `TestCount` (number): Total tests executed
- `PassedCount` (number): Passed tests
- `FailedCount` (number): Failed tests
- `SkippedCount` (number): Skipped tests
- `XmlPath` (string): Path to NUnit XML result file. Empty string when no XML was saved (typically on `Success: true`); populated only when tests failed and the XML file exists on disk.
- `ClearedPausePointIds` (string[], optional): IDs of pause points that were cleared before test execution. Omitted from JSON when no pause points were active.
- `FailedTests` (array, optional): Up to 10 failed leaf tests with `FullName`, `Message`, and when the stack trace contains a path:line location, `File` and `Line`. Omitted when no tests failed. When `FailedCount` is greater than 10, `Message` ends with `first 10 of N failures listed; see XmlPath for full results.`
- `SkippedTests` (string[], optional): Up to 10 full names of skipped leaf tests. Omitted when no tests were skipped. When `SkippedCount` is greater than 10, only the first 10 names are listed.
- `CompileNote` (string, optional): States that the automatic compile ran and succeeded before the tests and names `--skip-compile` as the opt-out. Omitted when `--skip-compile` was passed; a failed compile returns the compile error response instead.

### XML Result File

When tests fail, NUnit XML results are automatically saved to `{project_root}/.uloop/outputs/TestResults/<timestamp>.xml`. The XML contains per-test-case results including:

- Test name and full name
- Pass/fail/skip status and duration
- For failed tests: `<message>` (assertion error) and `<stack-trace>`
